# RuneScape-Discord-Chat-Sync

A RuneScape Companion and Discord bot that synchronizes a RuneScape Friends/Clan
Chat with Discord chat.

RuneScape-Discord Chat Sync is a bot written in JavaScript that uses Puppeteer
to simulate a user using the RuneScape Companion web app to chat in the
Friends/Clan Chat (it's easily configurable). When it reads a message in the
RuneScape chat it outputs it to the Discord chat, and when it reads a message
in the Discord chat it outputs it in the RuneScape chat, keeping the two chats
synced.

This bot can be useful for users who want to continue a RuneScape conversation
without playing the game, or to keep chat logs.

It is currently under development on GitHub at:
